## 4. Test Results

The Big Five Personality Test provides users with a report that ranks their personality traits based on their responses. Here's how to interpret the test results:

- Scores: The test results display scores for each of the five major personality traits: extraversion, neuroticism, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness to experience. Each score represents the user's level of the corresponding trait.

- Percentile Ranking: The test results also provide a percentile ranking for each personality trait. The percentile indicates how the user's score compares to others. For example, a percentile score of 85 for extraversion means the user is more extraverted than 85 out of 100 people.

- Interpretation: Users can interpret their test results based on their scores and percentile rankings. Higher scores indicate a stronger presence of a particular trait, while lower scores indicate a weaker presence. Percentile rankings provide context by comparing the user's scores to others.
